Which jobs are most crucial?
	The coders and debuggers are the most crucial jobs. They focus on achieving
	desired results while maintaining compliability. 

Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
	Square class, NumberSquare class, and Mine class are the key components
	that works together to simulate a minesweeper game. 

Which components are prerequisites for others?
	The Square class acts as the parent of the NumberSquare class and the Mine
	class. It's also necessary to setup a suitable background and size since
	we're working with Processing.

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
	Coding can be collaboratively tackled; each member devotes a good portion
	of their time to the code every day but separately from one another. Tasks
	that can be delegated are updating the devlog and fleshing out the READ.me.

What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
